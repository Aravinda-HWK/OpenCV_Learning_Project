This is the project that I used to learn about OpenCV which is a strong python library. OpenCV is used to image processing project that is mainly focused area in machine learning field. I learn this and do this project along with the youtube video series which was published on the Tech With Tim youbute channel. I learned corner detection, color detection, object detection, face and eye detection using openCV library and numpy. This project is fully developed using python language.
